May 2023, memory products such as SSDs and DRAMs are much cheaper now.  
The SSD in my current Windows PC is a Gen.4-compatible motherboard, but I am using a Gen.3 SSD.  
While the price was low, I bought a "[Samsung 980 PRO 2TB](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B09G6HVRL6?tag=maftracking364812-22&linkCode=ure&creative=6339)" with a high-end heatsink.  
The [WD Green SN350 2TB] was the C drive, but I replaced the [Samsung 980 PRO 2TB] with the C drive and the [WD Green SN350 2TB] with the D drive for data.  
The 2TB HDD was attached as the D drive, but this was removed.  
The case is now very clean with no SATA connected devices.

# Samsung 980 PRO heatsink 2TB

It was purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B09G6HVRL6?tag=maftracking364812-22&linkCode=ure&creative=6339) and priced at 20,734 yen.
At the beginning of 2023, the price was close to 30,000 yen, so the price seems much lower.

# Conclusion

Perhaps because the random access performance has not changed much, it does not seem to be much faster by feel.  
However, copying a single file with a large capacity is fast, as expected of a Gen. 4 SSD.  
To be honest, a Gen. 3 SSD is sufficient for everyday use, and only those who play games or edit videos will benefit from it.
